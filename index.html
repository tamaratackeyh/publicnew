    <br>(Most) other projects are promising <span style="color: rgb(255, 221, 0);">"utility"</span> and <span style="color: rgb(255, 221, 0);">"exclusive memberships"</span>, talking about infinite <span style="color: rgb(255, 221, 0)">scalability" </span> and hinting at unthinkable long term profit; all repeating the same exact nonsense.

  <label for="faq0"><h3 class="pitanje">What are the mint phases and is there a whitelist?</h3><i class="material-icons">ðŸ¡»</i></label>
  <p class="odgovor">Yes, there is!<br>
    Each mint phase will last a maximum of 72 hours, after which minting will close forever.<br>
    <br>
    Phase 1) Free whitelist mint (5000 tokens / 1 free mint per wallet): 22nd-24th July.<br>
    Requirement: Follow @  on Twitter, tag three friends on the latest post, Retweet, upvote. <br>
    Post your ETH wallet in a comment, and it will be added on the whitelist.<br>
    <br>
    Phase 2) Presale [0.03 eth]: 25th-27th July<br>
    (The remaining tokens will still be available for at a cheap price, adjusted for the current bear market)<br>
    <br>
    Phase 3) Public sale [0.05 eth] (If any tokens are left unminted): 28th - 30th July.<br>
    (For NFT flippers that are late due to waiting for proof of social popularity, but still early enough for resale profits on the secondary market).</p>

  <input type="checkbox" id="faq1">
  <label for="faq1"><h3 class="pitanje">Is there a guaranteed mint allowlist?</h3><i class="material-icons">ðŸ¡»</i></label>
  <p class="odgovor">Yup! We want a lot of apples in our canopy, so we're happily giving away 5000 of our sweetest lil apples that are in need of a loving home (or rather, garden.)</p>
  
  <hr><br>
  <input type="checkbox" id="faq2">
  <label for="faq2"><h3 class="pitanje">This sounds cool. How do I get involved?</h3><i class="material-icons">ðŸ¡»</i></label>
  <p class="odgovor">A great place to start is our Discord, home to a large and very active community of Lil Apple enthusiasts. You donâ€™t need to be a Lil Applet holder to join us there! All are welcome to jump into the conversation, let us know your ideas, and hang out with many others who like the Apples!<br>
    <br>
    See that crazy rainbow button in the upper right corner? Yeah, that's us.</p>

  <input type="checkbox" id="faq3">
  <label for="faq3"><h3 class="pitanje">What are the maximum mints per wallet?</h3><i class="material-icons">ðŸ¡»</i></label>
  <p class="odgovor">5000 are free gifts, and there's one for everybody.<br>
    <br>
     In case you want to expand your growbox, you can adopt up to 5 during the presale, or as much as you like during the public sale.

    <label for="faq4"><h3 class="pitanje">Mindmap?</h3><i class="material-icons">ðŸ¡»</i></label>
    <p class="odgovor">We are creating a Nexus where everyone will be able to voice themselves and receive feedback and acknowledgment.<br>
      <br>
      Your LAW token is your Nexus ID, acting as proof of early support and providing additional perks.<br>
      The Nexus will be community-driven and creators-supported, connecting Developers, Artists, Flippers, and Collectors to provide mutual support to gain financial independence and achieve hobby/career goals.<br>
      <br>
      (If our vision seems unclear, feel free to join any of our social channels, and your question will be answered).<br>
      <br>
      Our goal is to create a brand by making our community, if just a little bit, wealthier, informed, knowledgeable, and connected.<br>
      As the project budget accumulates from the cheap sales, we will be able to fulfill all the set milestones, which are chosen by the community through majority vote, prior to project release.<br>
      <br>
      The goal is to eventually create a better NFT, where the holders of paid LAW tokens will be guaranteed new token airdrops, and once again, a part will be possible to mint for free.<br>
      The budget for the next project and airdrop gas fees will be funded by the Lil' Apple WRLD project.<br>
      The projects wallet balance can be seen by everyone, everything will be transparent.<br>
      <br>
      Each LAW token is helping our ecosystem by planting a new apple seed in one of the most air polluted cities in the world. 10,000 trees is a lot of trees to plant, though our small team can handle it and we will be happy to! It will be documented so everyone can see the progress (and tons of internet clout, <em>obviously</em>).</p>

  <input type="checkbox" id="faq5">
  <label for="faq5"><h3 class="pitanje">But is there utility?</h3><i class="material-icons">ðŸ¡»</i></label>
  <p class="odgovor">There is no "utility". Utility is a fancy word collection creators use to lie to their supporters.<br>
    99% of people are here to make a profit. It is in our best interest to make sure everybody gets a "piece of the cake".<br> 
    <br>
    If we are all supporting the project (creators promoting & the community supporting), the project will blow up. 
    Every single person counts, and this project will be more successful if everyone does their tiny part,
    hence we are "United".<br>
    Don't be greedy waiting for "50x degenerate gainz", and consider selling your token after you double or triple your investment.</p>

  <input type="checkbox" id="faq6">
  <label for="faq6"><h3 class="pitanje">Membership?</h3><i class="material-icons">ðŸ¡»</i></label>
  <p class="odgovor">Token owners will participate in events such as NFT claims, raffles, community giveaways
    (non-owners will also participate, but with lower chances).<br>
    Each apple acts as a vote for collection experiences and activities.<br> 
    We are very open to hear and implement your suggestions on more perks.<br>
    <br>
    Real life events can happen when the minimum necessary budget is met.</p>

    300: For raffles and community giveaways<br>
    100: For future collaborations, marketing, and advisors<br>

  <label for="faq10"><h3 class="pitanje">Where does my NFT go after I purchase a lil Apple?</h3><i class="material-icons">ðŸ¡»</i></label>

  <input type="checkbox" id="faq11">
  <label for="faq11"><h3 class="pitanje">Are Lil Apples a good investment?</h3><i class="material-icons">ðŸ¡»</i></label>
  <p class="odgovor">If you can mint it for free, you have everything to gain and nothing to lose.<br>
     Ethereum is rapidly losing value and gas prices are laughably low. Even the presale price is cheap compared to other collections. Lil Apple WRLD stands out as an project behind an honest and trusted team.<br>
    <br> 
    Ultimately, this is a decision for you to make. We believe the Lil Apples have a long life ahead of them, and will be an ever-growing and evolving project.</p>
